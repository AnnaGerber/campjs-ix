CampJS call for papers is now open!

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGGf4jZLf4SQNBljGxdxqtOZ7XR_sd4xFSoeZ8qpCJfMeY2A/viewform">Submit a talk/workshop</a>

Closes midnight 29th April 2018. You will hear back from us before 1st June.

We are quite impressed with how [CSSConf](https://2018.jsconfau.com/call-for-speakers) is addressing diversity in speakers. The selection process for speakers for this year will be similar to [CSSConf](https://2018.jsconfau.com/call-for-speakers). 

# Topic suggestions

While we’re open to a wide range of topics; we’re particularly interested in talks that somewhat fit in the spectrum of:

* Cutting-edge advancements in the world of JavaScript
* JavaScript-powered audio and visuals
* JavaScript automation
* Making art with JavaScript
* New, interesting angles on JavaScript frameworks
* Robotics and hardware
* Virtual Reality
* Being a better developer
* The state and future of the JavaScript community
* Ridiculous, wild ideas and projects
* And finally: whatever you want, this is your conference!

If you’re unsure whether the proposal fits into the conference feel free to submit it nonetheless to avoid missing out on the speaking opportunity.

We’d love to hear what you’re passionate about!


# How to write a good proposal?

Here’s what we expect from a proposal:

* __Language__: All talks are in English.
* __Talk Duration__: Talks should be under 30 minutes long. Questions at the end if time permits.
* __Workshop Duration__: Workshops are variable length. Let us know how long you need.
* __Conciseness__: Keep the proposal short and sweet—up to four paragraphs. It’s tempting to write a lengthy description to fully convey the idea in your head, but due to the amount of submissions we get it makes a big difference if a proposal makes a good impression straight away.
* __Formatting__: Write with care. Typos, sloppy formatting, all-lowercase proposals will reflect negatively on the outcome of your submission.
* __Originality__: We’re committed to pushing the community forward, which is why we favour original content. There’s nothing wrong with a talk that has already been given elsewhere though, if it will be presented with new information or demonstrations, making it unique for our audience.

# We can help

We know that not everyone considers themselves a potential speaker. Delivering a talk can be challenging. Designing beautiful slides might feel impossible. Live demos can go wrong in so many ways.

We believe anyone can become a speaker.  **We’re here to help and guide you to develop skills to deliver a stellar talk.**

Here’s what we can do:

* Brainstorm general ideas for a talk (just drop us an [email](mailto:team@campjs.com), but remember to **not disclose talk titles or full abstracts** as it might disqualify your future submissions).
* Connect you to experienced speakers, who can offer mentorship in preparing a great talk.
* Provide advice on creating a great slide deck, from typography, colours, copy-writing to accessibility and Code of Conduct compliance.
* Rehearse the talk with you via Skype, phone or over a cuppa here in Melbourne.
* Connect you to local groups if you’d like to practice in front of a friendly crowd.

Additionally, you might find these materials helpful:

# The selection process

Here’s how it’ll work in a nutshell:

* All submissions are anonymised with a carefully curated amount of conscious bias.
* All talks are reviewed and voted on by the conference organisers based on the following criteria:
* * relevance to the community
* * clarity and cohesiveness of the proposal
* * originality of the talk
* Triaged submissions are completely de-anonymised and we select the final lineup.
* Call for Speakers participants are notified, no matter the outcome.

# Code of Conduct

By applying to speak you agree to follow the conference [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). We are committed to providing a harassment-free, professional and welcoming environment for all attendees.

Speakers should pay particular attention and avoid using visuals, audio or language that may potentially be considered offensive or harmful (sexual, racist, homophobic, insensitive, etc.) as it will not be tolerated.
