CampJS is organised by a large group of volunteers. Where privacy is not an issue, everything is organised in public in the <a href='https://github.com/campjs/campjs-next/issues'>Github issues</a>.

If you would like to volunteer, you don't have to ask permission, just jump in. However if you're unsure, message one or many of us privately. We are happy to help.

During CampJS, you'll also find emergency contact numbers on your nametag.
