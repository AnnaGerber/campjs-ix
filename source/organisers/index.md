CampJS is organised by a large group of volunteers. Where privacy is not an issue, everything is organised in public in the <a href='https://github.com/campjs/campjs-next/issues'>Github issues</a>.

If you would like to volunteer, you don't have to ask permission, just jump in. However if you're unsure, message one or many of us privately. We are happy to help.

During CampJS, you'll also find emergency contact numbers on your nametag.

# Get involved
Even though CampJS has been around for a few years, we are still figuring things out.

* *Issue tracker:* We organise as much of CampJS in the open as possible on <a href="https://github.com/campjs/campjs-next/issues">Github issues</a>.
* *Slack*: We have a Slack chat on <a href="https://wealljs.org/">WeAllJS</a> which you can get access to with the command<br>`/join-private #campjs`

## Volunteer for the weekend
We always need volunteers through the weekend.

If you want to volunteer but don't know where to start, the best place is to fill out the volunteer form. We can get in touch to let you know what kind of jobs you can do.

## Run a side-activity
We're always looking for people to run activities on the side.

If you have a hobby you want to bring to camp (think bushwalking, drone flying, knitting, music) let us know:

1. <a href="https://github.com/campjs/campjs-ix/issues/new">Create an issue</a> letting us know what your activity is
1. Let us know how much time you're willing to set aside for it on the weekend (a couple of hours, a full day etc) and we'll add it to the schedule
1. Don't forget to include some info about what your activity will be like, and what campers need to bring
