## Accomodation for couples
If you and your partner are attending CampJS as a couple, you can opt to share a dorm in the mixed-gender dorms.

Couples dorms are mixed-gender dorms which are only offered to folks bringing a partner who would prefer to remain together.

Please let us know when booking so we can set aside enough rooms.

## Womens dorms
We have separated accommodation for women with their own bathrooms and common room.

If you are bringing a partner you're welcome to choose either the womens dorms or couples accommodation. Please let us know when booking so we can set aside enough rooms.

Bathrooms in the common areas of the camp are non gendered and attendees are supported in using the accommodation and bathroom options that they are comfortable with.
